# Drone-detection

Motivation:

    1. Curiosity to explore and learn about how Neural Networks really learn.
    2. Exitement to know what kind of value I can extract from these kind of image datasets.
Goal:

    To develop a model that can detect Drones, Airplanes, Helicopters etc.,
Achievement:

    1. Fine-tuned the model several times, and achieved a model with less to no Overfitting
    2. The model has achieved 90% accuracy on unseen test data (which is more than I expected)
